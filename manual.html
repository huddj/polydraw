<h1>Polydraw</h1>

<p>Polydraw is a polygon and line based drawing tool in a Cartesian coordinate system.</p>

<h4>Shapes:</h4>
<p>All polygons and lines are organized by the shape system. Shapes are invisible points in space that polygons or other shapes are located in reference to. The 'root' of every drawing is a shape (that should be) located at (0, 0).</p>

<h4>Polygons:</h4>
<p>Polygons are drawn in reference to a shape. When that shape's relative coordinates change, all the polygons that are 'children' of that shape will move accordingly.</p>

<h4>Layers:</h4>
<p>Higher layers are displayed above lower layers.</p>

<h4>Selection:</h4>
<p>The selection menu at the bottom of the screen shows information about the currently selected shape/polygon. It can be used to edit the selected object's properties and to navigate the object tree. Buttons in the selection menu only work if the select tool is active.</p>

<h4>Colors:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Green: Shape selection</li>
<li>Blue: Current active parent shape</li>
<li>Red: Polygon selection and creation | polygon point creation and selection</li>
<li>Purple: Polyline selection and creation | polyline point creation and selection</li>
<li>Orange: Point highlighting</li>
</ul>

<h4>Keys:</h4>
<p>For any of these key actions to have effect, the canvas must be focused. Most of the time it will be, but sometimes after editing a text value escape needs to be pressed to focus the canvas. The pointer must also be visible on the canvas.</p>
<ul>
<li>A: "Assign" - If a shape is selected, set it as the current active parent</li>
<li>B: "Back" - Select parent of currently selected shape; if a point is selected, select the polygon/polyline the points belongs to</li>
<li>C: "Create" - If a polygon/polyline is selected, add a point to the end; if a point is selected add a point before it</li>
<li>D: "Delete" - Delete currently selected shape/polygon/polyline/point</li>
<li>L: "Line" - Enter polyline creation tool; confirm line after clicking points (creates line relative to current active parent)</li>
<li>M: "Move" - Move shape/polygon/polyline/point</li>
<li>O: "Outline" - Create a polyline that outlines the current shape and select it</li>
<li>P: "Polygon" - Enter polygon creation tool; confirm polygon after clicking points (creates polygon relative to current active parent)</li>
<li>R: "Root" - Select root and set it as current active parent</li>
<li>S: "Shape" - Create shape (relative to current active parent)</li>
</ul>
